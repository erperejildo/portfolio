# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio repository! I‚Äôm Dani, a passionate software developer with over 14 years of experience in mobile and web development. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of exciting projects, leveraging modern technologies to build seamless, user-centric applications. This repository is a collection of my work, where you can explore some of the projects I‚Äôve contributed to, as well as a few of the technologies I‚Äôve used along the way.


## üöÄ Personal Projects
I've organized this section into three categories: Personal Projects (apps), Company Projects (websites), and Examples (demonstrating specific skills).

### Personal Work (Apps)
These are projects I‚Äôve developed independently. These apps reflect my creativity, passion for development, and desire to innovate. I'm always looking for new ideas (the most difficult part).

They are released for both Android and iOS (NOTE: iOS account is not active at the moment) and they all use Flutter/Dart and Firebase/Firestore. Some of these apps were made in the past using Angular, Ionic and PhoneGap/Cordova. Today, they are all native.

#### My Rents
My Rents: Property Manager Pro simplifies property management for both small and large portfolios. Easily organize and track properties, manage leases, and schedule tasks with detailed reminders. The app also provides essential tools like expense tracking, secure document storage, and automated bill generation for efficient financial management. With integrated map navigation and comprehensive reporting, managing your rental properties has never been easier.

## üåç Open Source Contributions

As an advocate for collaborative development and community-driven growth, I actively contribute to open-source projects. These contributions allow me to engage with the developer community, improve existing tools, and share my knowledge with others. Below are some of my contributions to open-source projects.

### StackOverflow
I regularly ask questions on StackOverflow improve my understanding and overcome challenges, but at the same time, I enjoy giving back by answering questions from other developers, providing solutions and insights based on my experience

### Testing
I frequently incorporate third-party libraries into my projects, as they can significantly enhance functionality. However, I occasionally encounter bugs or areas for improvement within these libraries. When this happens, I take the initiative to assist the developers by reporting the issues, providing feedback, and contributing to testing efforts to ensure better performance and reliability.
